    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>This Slow Cooker Creamy Tortellini, Spinach and Chicken Soup is a delicious meal made all in one pot that will leave everyone saying yelling, “THAT WAS GOOD!”  No seriously, that’s what we all said (kids and adults alike).  If I could eat this soup every day this winter, I would be happy.</p>
    
    <p>This is a soup that you absolutely have to try.  It is so super good.  For reals!  You are going to love it.  It’s like a creamy tomato soup with cheesy tortellini and chicken and then a pop of color from the bright green spinach.</p>

        <li>Cover and cook on LOW for 4-6 hours or on HIGH for 3-4 hours (or until chicken is very tender).</li>
        <li>Remove the lid use a fork to remove the chicken out of the slow cooker.  And add in tortellini and spinach, Parmesan cheese and warmed cream (cream should be warmed because it may cause curdling if added in cold).</li>
        <li>On a cutting board, shred or cut the chicken into bite-size pieces. Add the chicken back into the slow cooker. Put the lid back on and cook on HIGH for about 10 more minutes, or until the tortellini are cooked through. Ladle into serving bowls and enjoy!</li>
